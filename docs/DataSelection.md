## Data Selection in Achilles

This outline describes the process of randomly selecting files from directories containing read files (`Fast5`) to subset large read data sets from sequencing runs (> 100,000) that are held in storage. The subset can then be used for generating datasets for training and evaluation, and serve as a base for reading files for prediction tasks in Achilles.
